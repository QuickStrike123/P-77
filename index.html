    <h1>Project on Console</h1>
    <p>Visual code studio's is all about coding.You can mainly focus on the javascript.So far i am learning about the Console . log and i think it is amazing so go and download visual code studio over <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">Here</a> . i hope you have as much fun doing it.</p>
    <p>The Console screen is useful because if you want to print something you can not see it on the main screen.But you can see it only on the Console screen.You can open the console screen by right clicking the sreen and click on inspect after that at the bottom of your screen you will see something saying Element,Console,sources etc.Click on console you can look at the code you console . loged</p>
    <script>
        console.log("My first console project");
        var first = "Mokshit";
        var last = "Potru";
        var full = first.concat(" ").concat(last);
        console.log(full);
        var num1 = 17;
        var num2 = 32;
        var divide = num1/num2;
        console.log(divide);
        var multi = num1*num2;
        console.log(multi);
        var add = num1+num2;
        console.log(add);
